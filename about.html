            Charles Buscarino is a recent graduate from Fordham University with a bachelor’s degree in English Literature. Since an early age, Charles has always loved science fiction and fantasy, immersing himself in media of all kinds as long as they dealt with anything weird. The Nerd Post, while not exactly a newspaper, serves as his expression of his thoughts on all things nerd. He hopes this site can be used as a demonstration of his talents and area of expertise as a writer, if not only to share his opinions.
