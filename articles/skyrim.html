            Like many college students in the wake of COVID I recently found myself rightfully
removed from my New York college campus and sent back home with the parting gift (or curse)
of an abundance of time and very few ways to spend it. Freshly devoid of face-to-face
interactions with friends and swindled of the festivities that would come with the final days of
my senior year, I turned to my tried-and-tested aegis from my steadily growing feelings of
nihilism at the increasingly bleak state of society and the world at large: video games. But I
could not just play any old video game. In the increasingly low chances of a speedy end to the
pandemic I needed a game that I couldn’t necessarily lose myself in but dunk my head into like a
panicked ostrich. Then it hit me. What else could it be other than the lord of time-wasting? The
eternally-remastered? The golden udder of Todd Howard’s cash cow? I of course am referring to
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
So, like a Loony-Tunes anvil, I dropped forty dollars on Skyrim Special Edition. I hastily
an Imperial character, hastily dubbed him ‘Coronius Quarantino’ and set him up as a heavily
armored, dual-wielding warrior. I hadn’t played Skyrim since I had been in high school, and
amongst the increasingly grim news I got bombarded with every day the waves of nostalgia were
surprisingly calming. Re-exploring the Skyrim’s mountains, cities, caves, and dungeons was like
visiting a friend I hadn’t seen in years.
For those that have not played Skyrim, the appeal is not difficult to see. Skyrim focuses
on the player character, known as the Dragonborn, who is the last hope for the game’s titular
realm as the encroaching threat of dragons throws the world in chaos. However, the experience
became somewhat different after compared to my first playthrough close to 10 years ago. While
that story may sound like the fantasy save-the-world plot standard fare (and it is) Skyrim’s true
appeal comes from the size of its open world, and the sheer number of ways it can be played.
The player can become proficient in over 251 special abilities and use them all in a hub world
over 14 square miles in size, with hundreds of smaller dungeons to explore, filled with monsters
to slay, treasure to swindle, and secrets to uncover.
Even though I had dumped literal hundreds of hours into my first playthrough of Skyrim
about nine years ago while I was still in middle school, I came to a revelation about the game I
had loved so much: Skyrim a is weird game to play. While that statement may seem obvious
given that this is a game where, you can shout people to death (“to pieces” even!) Skyrim’s true
strangeness stems from pretty jarring disconnect in its story, presentation, and mechanics.
One of the first disconnects I noticed almost immediately was that the main player
character is quite possibly the most special person to ever exist. While the main story quest
hinges on the player’s status as the Dragonborn, a warrior that can harness the language of
dragons, through side quests the player can accrue enough titles to make Daenerys Targaryen
turn green with envy. Including the game’s bonus content, the player can become a spouse,
parent, homeowner, the leader of a group of werewolf mercenaries, head of an (literally)
underground crime syndicate, head of the largest conclave of mages in the province, prolific

bard, captain of guild of assassins for hire, killer of an emperor, slayer of dragons and their
patron demigod, killer of the first dragonborn, pseudo-mayor of nine separate cities, champion of
fifteen separate arch-demons, the singular deciding factor in a civil war, professional vampire
hunter (or vampire lord depending on your choices), have the ability to blot out the sun at will, as
well as doing hundreds of odd jobs for whoever corners you on the street. While it is difficult to
believe that any of this could actually happen to any one person over the course of their lifetime,
even within the confines of a fantasy universe, the real disconnect comes from something much
more encompassing. Despite wielding nearly godlike power by the later hours of the game, the
ultimate payoff of the player’s collective achievements is…nothing. More specifically, as the
player grows in power, the world does not change with them in meaningful ways. I noticed this
for the first time in interactions with the character named Nazeem, who continually mocked me
in passing for being lower class. Nazeem’s classist barbs may have made sense when I started
the game with 10 gold coins, but grew increasingly tiresome and nonsensical when I had over
200,000 coins, a sword forged from a star, and was major a political figure in the city he lived in.
While Nazeem’s little jokes (that I definitely didn’t murder him in broad daylight for)
may seem like a small feature overlooked by developers, it is indicative of a larger problem
present in the entire game. Your achievements however prolific have a tremendously small effect
on the world around you and how people treat you. In this way, the progress of your character is
purely mechanical rather than narrative. This mostly comes from the mechanics suggesting that
Bethesda wants to tailor to all styles of play. However, in attempting to appeal to all styles of
play, Skyrim ends up tailoring to none. In other words, the player’s potentiality of becoming so
multitalented they start to lose all definition; it is impossible from them to play the conquering
warrior, learned mage, dangerous monster, and mysterious stranger all at once, so the game treats
them like nobody at all. This is not helped by game lacking voice acting for the player character
and they are always referred to in gender neutral terms. In other words, while it does provide a
tremendously satisfying power trip, interacting with other characters in Skyrim often feels like
you’re Bianca in Lars and the Real Girl but there’s also elves.
While playing Skyrim, I found myself compulsively comparing it to its more grimdark
fantasy counterpart, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Released just 4 years after Skyrim, in The
Witcher 3, the player takes on the role of Geralt of Rivia, a mutant monster hunter for hire known
as a witcher. In the game’s world, simply known as “The Continent” witchers occupy a nebulous
niche in society, simultaneously rejected by society for their mutations but essential for their
monster-killing services. The in-game universe adapted from a series of novels by Andrej
Sapkowski is done remarkably well by game studio CD Projekt Red; characters have clear
motivations, the conflict is tangible, and describing the supporting cast as simply likable is doing
the stellar writing a disservice. However, the game is anchored by Geralt himself. First of all,
Geralt’s status as a Witcher gives the player a surprising amount of flexibility when it comes to
dialogue, as the player can understandably play Geralt as either a grizzled misanthrope or
sympathetic anti-hero. This is doubly remarkable as even with the multiple directions the player
can take Geralt, his tangibility in the plot and his relationships to those around him never felt
forced. Unlike my Dragonborn in Skyrim, playing Geralt made me believe that I had not only a

stake in the story, but a more tangible sway on its trajectory even if the ramifications of my own
actions was not readily apparent.
However, what makes Geralt an interesting character to play is that his skills are limited,
rather than having infinite potential. More specifically, The Witcher 3 breaks up its skills into
four skill trees focusing on swordplay, magic runes, alchemy, and utility skills, most of which
tweak Geralt’s combat skills (with the exception of a jedi-mind-trick-esque rune that can be used
to unlock different dialogue options). What is interesting about these is that often, Geralt will be
using all of these skills in combat, and the skill trees are used more like avenues in what players
want to specialize in. To that end, unlike Skyrim, there are no mechanics that the player can
completely ignore if they want to progress through the game.
In the end, I’m not saying that Skyrim was a bad game, or even that The Witcher 3 was
better. I enjoyed delving into hundreds of Skyrim’s dungeons and slaying its menagerie of fell
monsters, regardless of how many times I had done it, almost as much as I enjoyed the emotional
tale of Geralt of Rivia. Although what juxtaposing these games made apparent to me is the
complex philosophy of making a Role-Playing Game and to what degree game designers afford
their players. In a game where you can do anything and be anyone, it is nearly impossible to
write a singular story for all contingencies of what a player could decide to do with their blank
slate of a character. As a result, the players do not necessarily take on the role of a character, but
a living breathing plot-impetus, with very few interactions with characters feeling organic or
meaningful. On the other hand, game designers give the players a set character, one with
preestablished relationships, personal history and characters traits. However, because of this the
player’s freedom become whatever they want would be drastically reduced, as the player
character, like all characters would be defined by their limitations as much as their capabilities.
In playing a set character, the players are able to forge more meaningful relationships with other
NPC’s and dictate more meaningful decisions thanks to their character’s preestablished history.
In the end, when creating an RPG, game designers ultimately must decide between having blank
slate characters player can impose their own personalities onto at the expense of a more
compelling narrative anchor, or restrict a player’s abilities in order to create a more focused
narrative vision.
