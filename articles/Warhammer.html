          Warhammer 40k is very dumb. Warhammer is so outrageously, insanely, apocalyptically, earth-shatteringly, face-meltingly dumb and I love it so much that 
          I must write my own dumb little essay about it.

So what is Warhammer 40k? Warhammer 40k is a miniature tabletop wargame developed by Games Workshop that started in the 1980’s. 
          Essentially it’s like Chess but with its own flair of collectable figurines. Since the 80’s the franchise has branched out into dozens of video games, comics, short 
          films, and over 350 books. That wasn’t a typo. There are over 350 books written about this universe. 
          If this is your first time hearing about it, I’m honestly not surprised. This hobby far bigger than most people give it credit for, and despite that 
          it’s understandable why many find it to be off putting when they first encounter it.

            <!-- Copy all of the text of your article into this section. 
                After every paragraph, type <br><br>. This creates spaces between them.
                If you want an image to be the width of the article, type the following after the <br><br> of the article you want it to follow:
                <img src="../images/[filename].[filetype]" width=100%><br><br>
                If you want an image to be in line with a paragraph, put this code around the paragraph:
                <div class="side-image">
                    [paragraph]
                    <img src="../images/[filename].[filetype]">
                </div><br><br>
                For this line of code to access your image, you must upload the image into the "images" file first.
                If you put it in a subfolder of the images folder, instead type ../images/[subfolder]/[filename].[filetype] inside the quotation marks.
